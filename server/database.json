TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), and stay up to date via [our blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/typescript).\n\nFind others who are using TypeScript at [our community page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/community/).\n\n## Installing\n\nFor the latest stable version:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\n\nFor our nightly builds:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript@next\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to TypeScript.\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n* Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pulls).\n* Engage with other TypeScript users and developers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript).\n* Help each other in the [TypeScript Community Discord](https://discord.gg/typescript).\n* Join the [#typescript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TypeScript) discussion on Twitter.\n* [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n* Read the language specification ([docx](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.docx?raw=true),\n [pdf](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf?raw=true), [md](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)).\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see\nthe [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com)\nwith any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Documentation\n\n*  [TypeScript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)\n*  [Programming handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)\n*  [Language specification](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)\n*  [Homepage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n\n## Building\n\nIn order to build the TypeScript compiler, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.\n\nClone a copy of the repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript.git\n```\n\nChange to the TypeScript directory:\n\n```bash\ncd TypeScript\n```\n\nInstall [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) tools and dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g gulp\nnpm install\n```\n\nUse one of the following to build and test:\n\n```\ngulp local             # Build the compiler into built/local.\ngulp clean             # Delete the built compiler.\ngulp LKG               # Replace the last known good with the built one.\n                       # Bootstrapping step to be executed when the built compiler reaches a stable state.\ngulp tests             # Build the test infrastructure using the built compiler.\ngulp runtests          # Run tests using the built compiler and test infrastructure.\n                       # Some low-value tests are skipped when not on a CI machine - you can use the\n                       # --skipPercent=0 command to override this behavior and run all tests locally.\n                       # You can override the specific suite runner used or specify a test for this command.\n                       # Use --tests=<testPath> for a specific test and/or --runner=<runnerName> for a specific suite.\n                       # Valid runners include conformance, compiler, fourslash, project, user, and docker\n                       # The user and docker runners are extended test suite runners - the user runner\n                       # works on disk in the tests/cases/user directory, while the docker runner works in containers.\n                       # You'll need to have the docker executable in your system path for the docker runner to work.\ngulp runtests-parallel # Like runtests, but split across multiple threads. Uses a number of threads equal to the system\n                       # core count by default. Use --workers=<number> to adjust this.\ngulp baseline-accept   # This replaces the baseline test results with the results obtained from gulp runtests.\ngulp lint              # Runs eslint on the TypeScript source.\ngulp help              # List the above commands.\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nnode built/local/tsc.js hello.ts\n```\n\n\n## Roadmap\n\nFor details on our planned features and future direction please refer to our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap).",

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).\n\n## Installation\n\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:\n\n* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.\n* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.\n* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\n\nYou can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/docs).  \n\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.\n\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\n\n* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)\n* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)\n* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)\n* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)\n* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)\n* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)\n\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).\n\n## Examples\n\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```jsx\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" />,\n  document.getElementById('container')\n);\n```\n\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\n\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\n\n### [Code of Conduct](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct)\n\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n### [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute.html)\n\nRead our [contributing guide](https://reactjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute.html) to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\n\n### Good First Issues\n\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.\n\n### License\n\nReact is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).",
